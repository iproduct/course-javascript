CORS can be used as a modern alternative to the JSONP pattern. 
While JSONP supports only the GET request method, CORS also supports 
other types of HTTP requests. Using CORS enables a web programmer to 
use regular XMLHttpRequest which supports better error handling than 
JSONP. On the other hand, JSONP works on legacy browsers which preclude 
CORS support. CORS is supported by most modern web browsers.
